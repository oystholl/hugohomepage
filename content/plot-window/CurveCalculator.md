The summary curve calculator is a tool to do relative simple vector calculations on a set of curves. The created curves can be stored for later use in the project.

The calculator can be run by pressing the calculator icon {{< image-in-text src="/images/plot-window/calculator.png" >}} in the menu bar, or by right-clicking on either a summary case or the summary plot collection.

## Calculation Settings
To make a new calculated curve, click on **New Calculation**. This will add a new calculation to **Calculated Summaries**. Before choosing which curves to do calculations on, a calculation expression must be made. The default expression *Calculation_1 := x + y* will do a vector addition on the curves which *x* and *y* are placeholders for, and assign it to the calculation *Calculation_1*. How to assign curves to assign to *x* and *y* will be covered in section [Summary Address Selection](#summary-address-selection).

### Unit
It is possible to add a unit to the calculated curve, in the field **Unit** beneath the expression field. This will be used as the label on the y-axis when the curve is used in a plot.

## Summary Address Selection
An expression consists of placeholders (variables) for curves (summary address). By clicking **Parse Expression**, the variables will appear in the table below the settings. To assign a summary address to a variable, click **Edit**. This action will open a **Summary Address Selection** dialog. Use the dialog to select a summary address and press **OK**. Repeat the procedure for all the variables.

## Generating Curves
After assigning summary addresses to all variables, click **Calculate** to evaluate the expression. The curve is saved and can be accessed in the Plot Editor selecting the Summary Type: **Calculated**.

The curves can also be found in an existing curve's **Property Editor**. Choose the case **Calculated**, and the curves will appear in **Vector Selection**.
