ResInsight 2018.11 is the latest version of ResInsight, the professional quality, open source 3D visualization, curve plotting and post-processing tool for Eclipse reservoir models. Version 2018.11 contains a larger number of new and exciting features, some of which are listed below.

## Local Grid Refinement (LGR)
![LGR Type 1]({{< relref "" >}}images/introduction/TemporaryLGR_CompletionType.png) ![LGR Type 2](../../images/introduction/TemporaryLGR_CompletionType2.png)

Local Grid Refinement (LGR) can be created based on Eclipse simulations. The refined grids can also be visualised in 3D.

See [Completions LGR]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/completionslgr)

## Well Path Creation

ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self-established well path will behave in the same way as a regular imported well path.

See [Create Well Paths]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/createwellpaths)

## Contour Maps

ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D map.

See [Contour Maps]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/contourmaps)

## Summary Plotting

## Well Bore Stability Plots and Casing Design
![Well Bore Stability Plots]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}images/introduction/WellBoreStabilityPlots.png)

ResInsight can create **Well Bore Stability** plots for Geomechanical cases. These plots are specialized **Well Log Plots** and contain a visualization of Formations, Well Path Attributes as well as a set of well path derived curves in two different tracks.

See [Well Bore Stability Plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wellborestabilityplots)

## Memory Management
![Memory Management]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}images/introduction/MemoryManagementBanner.png)

ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. A Memory Management system is now in place to help the user if available memory is low.

See [Memory Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/memorymanagement)
