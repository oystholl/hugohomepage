ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self created well path will behave the same way as an ordinary imported well path.

To create a well path:

1. Right click **Wells** in the project tree
2. Select **Create Well Path** in the context menu. A new well node and a well targets node are created.
3. Click in the 3D view on locations where the well path will pass (targets). Note. A 3D object must be hit when clicking. Clicking in thin air will not work.
4. When finished placing targets, click on "Stop Picking Targets" in the property editor

Well targets property editor fields

- **UTM Reference Point** - Reference point. Defaults to the first target point clicked
- **MDRKB at First Target** - Define MD (referenced to Rotary Kelly Bushing) at first target point. Applies to well path export only.
- **Well Targets:** List of targets. Will have pink background when in picking state.
  - **Point** - Target position relative to reference point
  - **DL in** - Dog leg inwards. Unit: Degrees/30m
  - **DL out** - Dog leg outwards. Unit: Degrees/30m
  - **Dir** - Check box for overriding well path auto calculated directions
  - **Azi (deg)** - Azimuth. Y axis is 0 degrees
  - **Inc (deg)** - Inclination. Z axis is 0 degrees

A self created well path may be edited by either editing coordinates in the property editor or clicking and dragging targets in the 3D view.

Clicking and dragging the blue part of a target, it can be moved along the Z axis only. Clicking and dragging the magenta part of a target, it can be moved freely around.

### Well Plan
A well plan can be displayed by selecting **Show Well Plan** from the context menu of a generated well path.
