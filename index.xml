      <description>This section describes how Faults are detected and visualized. NNC&amp;rsquo;s are a part of the Faults visualization and are thus also mentioned in this section.
Fault Detection ResInsight always scans the grids for geometrical faults when they are loaded. When two opposite cell faces of I, J, K neighbor cells does not match geometrically, they are tagged.
All the tagged cell faces are then compared to the faults possibly imported from the *.</description>

      <guid>http://ceesol.no/3d-main-window/customization/memorymanagement/</guid>
      <description>ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. If the requirements starts approaching the available physical memory on the workstation, ResInsight may become unstable and crash, as the operating system starts freeing memory to avoid system failure. To help alleviate this, ResInsight has some built-in memory management tools.

      <description>Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &amp;ldquo;Current Case&amp;rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.</description>

The third track contains curves showing different stability gradients (all normalized by mud weight): - FG: Fracture Gradient for sands based on Kirsch. - OBG: Overburden stress gradient: Stress component S_33.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can display well logs by extracting data from a simulation model along a well trajectory and from imported LAS-files. Extracted simulation data can be exported to LAS-files for further processing.
Well Log Plots Well log plots can be created in several ways:
 Right-click a well path or a simulation well, either in the Project Tree or in the 3D-view.
Select New Well Log Extraction Curve.
A new plot with a single Track and a Curve is created.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can import Well trajectories from simple Ascii files. In addition, a Statoil specific solution to retrieve Well Trajectories from their internal web service is implemented.
ResInsight also supports creation of your own user-defined well paths. See Create Well Paths
Ascii Well Trajectories The command File -&amp;gt; Import -&amp;gt; Well Data -&amp;gt; Import Well Paths From File will read the well paths in the selected file, and create one entry for each trajectory under the Wells item in the Project Tree.</description>
