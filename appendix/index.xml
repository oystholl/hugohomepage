      <description>ResInsight computes several derived results. In this section we will explain what they are, and briefly how they are calculated.
Derived Results for Eclipse Cases ResInsight calculates several derived cell properties that is made available as Static or Dynamic cell properties. The derived results listed at the bottom of the Static result properties, are shown below.
Transmissibility Normalized by Area The transmissibility for cells and Non-Neighbor Connections (NNCs) are dependent on both cell properties and geometry.</description>

      <description>Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &amp;ldquo;Current Case&amp;rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.</description>

      <description>A regression tool for QA is build into ResInsight. This tool will do the following:
 Scan a directory for sub directories containing a RegressionTest.rsp files. Each found project file will be opened, and all views in this project will be exported as snapshot images to file. When snapshot images from all projects are completed, difference images based on generated and QA-approved images are computed. Based on these three sets of images, an HTML report is created and automatically displayed.</description>
